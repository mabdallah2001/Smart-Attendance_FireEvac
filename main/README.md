###### TODO

Read from a file to run different scenarios for final presentation. Have a enter button to progress to the next scenario

<!-- Have meta-data records for each person even if detected -->

<!-- Maybe have a number like Guest 1, Guest 2, etc. based on time of entry. -->

### List of Scenarios


1. Guest's face with meta data is not detected in another room.

2. Person's face not detected in another room. Relocate them based on 90% matched meta data.

3. Person's face not detected when exitting the building


4. If guest moves from one room to another - error is generated
